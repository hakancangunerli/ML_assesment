The study aimed to develop an efficient and generalizable deep-learning method based on an UNet-like architecture for automated sarcopenia measurement using CT scans. The method employed FCNNs and image augmentation to detect the L3 vertebral level and segment the muscle area in unselected abdominal CT volumes. The threefold cross-validation showed high accuracy with no statistical difference between automated output and manual annotation. The fully automated processing was time-efficient and could potentially accelerate research for sarcopenia-based measurements in oncology and other populations. However, some segmentation failure cases were observed, and low section detection confidence could lead to rejection of some cases.
